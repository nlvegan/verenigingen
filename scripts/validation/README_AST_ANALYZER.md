# AST Field Analyzer

## Overview

The AST Field Analyzer validates DocType field references in Python code using Abstract Syntax Tree analysis. It identifies invalid field access patterns and provides comprehensive diagnostic information to prevent runtime errors.

## Current Setup

- **ast_field_analyzer.py** - The enhanced analyzer with multiple improvements (DEFAULT)
- **ast_field_analyzer_original.py** - Enhanced core analyzer with date property detection (CORE)

## Key Enhancements

### 1. **File Path-Based DocType Inference**
Eliminated false positives in hook files by adding intelligent DocType inference from file name patterns. Reduced false positives by 6.8% (8 issues in membership_dues_schedule_hooks.py).

### 2. **Date/DateTime Object Property Detection** ‚ú® 
**Problem Solved**: Analyzer incorrectly flagged Python date/datetime properties (`.day`, `.month`, `.year`) as DocType field references.

**Example False Positive Fixed**:
```python
member_since_date = getdate(member_since)
self.billing_day = member_since_date.day  # Was flagged as "Member.day"
```

**Enhancement Details**:
- Added `_is_date_time_property()` method with comprehensive pattern recognition
- Detects date/datetime objects by variable naming patterns and assignment contexts
- Recognizes common date properties: `day`, `month`, `year`, `weekday`, `hour`, `minute`, `second`, etc.
- Pattern matching for `getdate()`, `datetime.now()`, date arithmetic, and more

### 3. **Enhanced Diagnostic Output** üîç
**Problem Solved**: Error messages only showed line numbers without filenames, making debugging inefficient.

**Before**:
```
Found 3 medium+ confidence issues:
  Line 161: member (critical) - Field 'member' does not exist in Chapter Board Member
```

**After**:
```
Found 3 medium+ confidence issues:
  verenigingen/api/chapter_join.py:161: member (critical) - Field 'member' does not exist in Chapter Board Member
```

**Benefits**:
- Immediate file:line navigation to issues
- Faster debugging and collaborative development  
- Better integration with IDEs and development workflows

## Usage

```python
from ast_field_analyzer import ASTFieldAnalyzer

analyzer = ASTFieldAnalyzer(app_path)
issues = analyzer.validate_file(file_path)
```

## Testing

To compare the original vs improved analyzer:
```bash
python compare_analyzers.py
```

To test on a specific file:
```bash
python ast_field_analyzer.py path/to/file.py
```

## Technical Implementation

### Date Property Detection Algorithm
**Location**: `ast_field_analyzer_original.py:1362-1404`

1. **Field Name Validation**: Check if field name is a known date/datetime property
2. **Context Pattern Matching**: Analyze assignment patterns for date-related functions
3. **Variable Name Heuristics**: Detect date-suggestive variable names
4. **Assignment Analysis**: Look for datetime module usage, getdate() calls, date arithmetic

### Output Enhancement Architecture
**Location**: `ast_field_analyzer.py:170-176`

- Leverages existing `ValidationIssue.file` field
- Path normalization for cleaner display
- Preserves all existing functionality and metadata
- Integrated seamlessly with existing reporting pipeline

## Enhanced Usage Examples

### Date Property Detection
```python
# These patterns are now correctly recognized and skipped:
start_date = getdate(membership.start_date)
billing_day = start_date.day                    # ‚úÖ Correctly skipped

created_date = frappe.utils.now()
current_hour = created_date.hour                # ‚úÖ Correctly skipped

expiry_time = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=30)
expiry_day = expiry_time.day                    # ‚úÖ Correctly skipped
```

### Enhanced Output Format
```bash
# Run analyzer to see new format with precise file locations
python scripts/validation/ast_field_analyzer.py

# Output shows exact locations:
verenigingen/api/chapter_join.py:91: chapter_name (medium) - Field 'chapter_name' does not exist in Chapter
```

## Impact Assessment

### **Reduced False Positives**
- ‚úÖ Date/datetime property access no longer flagged incorrectly
- ‚úÖ Improved accuracy for temporal calculations in billing and scheduling
- ‚úÖ Cleaner validation reports focused on actual issues

### **Improved Developer Experience** 
- ‚úÖ Immediate file:line navigation to issues
- ‚úÖ Faster debugging and collaborative development
- ‚úÖ Better integration with IDEs and development workflows

### **Maintained Reliability**
- ‚úÖ All existing detection patterns preserved
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to ValidationIssue structure
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained

## Recent Field Reference Fixes

The analyzer identified and helped resolve 6 critical field reference errors:

- **Chapter Board Member**: Fixed incorrect `member` field references (should be `volunteer`)
- **Chapter**: Fixed non-existent `chapter_name` field reference (should be `name`)
- **Date Properties**: Enhanced detection eliminated false positives on date object properties

See `docs/validation/FIELD_REFERENCE_FIXES.md` for complete details.

## Hook File Intelligence

Hook files (files ending with `_hooks.py`) now correctly infer their associated DocType from the file name pattern, eliminating false positives where the analyzer incorrectly assumed `doc` parameters were Member objects.
