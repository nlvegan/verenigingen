# Critical Billing Tests: Advanced Prorating & Revenue Recognition

## Overview

Your verenigingen system now has comprehensive tests for the two most critical billing scenarios that can cause significant financial impact:

1. **Advanced Prorating** - Ensures accurate billing during membership transitions
2. **Revenue Recognition Automation** - Ensures accounting compliance and accurate financial reporting

## 🎯 **#1: Advanced Prorating - Why Critical**

### **Financial Impact of Errors:**
- **Under-billing**: Direct revenue loss
- **Over-billing**: Member complaints, refunds, reputation damage
- **Manual corrections**: Staff time, accounting complexity
- **Audit issues**: Incorrect financial statements

### **Real-World Scenarios Tested:**

#### **Monthly → Annual Upgrade (Mid-Month)**
```
Member pays €25/month, upgrades to €300/year on day 15

Calculation:
- Monthly daily rate: €25 ÷ 31 days = €0.806/day
- Annual daily rate: €300 ÷ 365 days = €0.822/day
- Days remaining: 17 days

Credit for unused monthly: €0.806 × 17 = €13.71
Charge for annual period: €0.822 × 17 = €13.97
Net amount owed: €0.26

✅ Test validates: Calculations are accurate, amounts reasonable
```

#### **Annual → Quarterly Downgrade (Large Credit)**
```
Member paid €300/year, downgrades after 3 months

Calculation:
- Monthly rate: €300 ÷ 12 = €25/month
- Months unused: 9 months
- Quarterly charge: €75 for current quarter

Credit for unused annual: €25 × 9 = €225
Net credit to member: €225 - €75 = €150

✅ Test validates: Large credits handled correctly, no overflow errors
```

#### **Leap Year Accuracy**
```
Annual membership prorating differs by year type:

Regular year (365 days): €300 ÷ 365 = €0.8219/day
Leap year (366 days): €300 ÷ 366 = €0.8197/day

For 30-day period:
- Regular year: €24.66
- Leap year: €24.59
- Difference: €0.07

✅ Test validates: System handles leap years correctly
```

### **Test Results:**
```
Ran 6 tests in 4.371s - PASSED
✅ Monthly→Annual upgrade prorating accurate
✅ Annual→Quarterly downgrade with €150 credit
✅ Mid-cycle suspension (50% refund)
✅ Bulk upgrade consistency across 100+ members
✅ Leap year daily rate differences handled
✅ Reactivation charges calculated properly
```

## 🎯 **#2: Revenue Recognition Automation - Why Critical**

### **Compliance Requirements:**
- **IFRS 15**: Revenue from Contracts with Customers
- **Dutch GAAP**: Proper revenue timing
- **Audit trails**: Automated recognition reduces errors
- **Monthly/quarterly reporting**: Books must be accurate

### **Real-World Scenarios Tested:**

#### **Annual Membership Revenue Spreading**
```
Member pays €240 upfront for annual membership

Required Recognition:
- Month 1: Recognize €20, Defer €220
- Month 2: Recognize €20, Defer €200
- ...
- Month 12: Recognize €20, Defer €0

✅ Test validates: Revenue spread evenly, deferred amounts decrease correctly
```

#### **Mid-Year Membership (Partial Periods)**
```
Member joins July 15th, pays €240 annual

Recognition Schedule:
- July: €10.97 (17/31 days × €20)
- Aug-Dec: €100.00 (5 full months × €20)
- Total 2025: €110.97
- Deferred to 2026: €129.03

✅ Test validates: Partial periods calculated accurately, no revenue gaps
```

#### **Cancellation Revenue Reversal**
```
Member cancels annual membership after 4 months

Reversal Required:
- Revenue recognized: €80 (4 months × €20)
- Revenue to reverse: €160 (8 months × €20)
- Refund amount: €160

✅ Test validates: Reversals match unearned revenue, refunds accurate
```

#### **Upgrade Recognition Adjustment**
```
Member upgrades quarterly (€75) to annual (€240) after 1.5 months

Adjustment Calculation:
- Original quarterly recognized: €37.50 (1.5 × €25)
- Remaining quarterly credit: €37.50
- New annual recognition: €30.00 (1.5 × €20)
- Net adjustment: -€7.50 (credit to member)

✅ Test validates: Complex adjustments handled correctly
```

### **Test Results:**
```
Ran 6 tests in 3.676s - OK
✅ Annual revenue spread over 12 months
✅ Mid-year partial period recognition
✅ Cancellation revenue reversal (€160)
✅ Quarterly monthly recognition (€25/month)
✅ Upgrade recognition adjustments
✅ Multi-member reporting totals accurate
```
